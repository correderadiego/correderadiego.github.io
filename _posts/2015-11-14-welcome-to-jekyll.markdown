On the last few days I have received my Icezum Alhambra. The very first Open FPGA board that can be used with open tools. This project comes from an initiative of the community. They have built the first 100 units, and I have one of them.

In this [link][icezum-wiki] you could obtain all the information of the board, the features and some videos.

The board comes preprogrammed with some code that you could find in this [link][user-test]. When you connect it to your PC the leds start blinking. You can choose your test mode pushing switch button one. This code includes the following modes :

 *  First test mode : Blinking leds.
 *  Second test mode : Knight rider mode.
 *  Third test mode  : The board send a message using the serial port (115200 baud) when you push switch button two. “Hola! Soy tu Icezum Alhambra :-)”
*  Fourth test mode : Echo mode. The code echoes the strings received using the serial port.

With this few tests we can check that our Icezum is working properly. Stay tunned for new updates !
