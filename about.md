It is always difficult to define someone and even more difficult if you have to define yourself. 

I am a Spanish Telecommunication Engineer. I am interested in technology mainly in robotics, 3d printing, audio and everything that could teach me something. I love open projects. I am an ehthusiastic of any electronic device and an amateur photographer too.

I will try to document all my projects in this blog and share them with you. Stay tunned!
